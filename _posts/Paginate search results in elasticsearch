# Paginate search results in Elasticsearch

I have to commit that I made a silly mistake.

The front end pass the page index value which is from 1. So I subconsciously think "1" is the first index for keyword "**from**" in Elasticsearch. Boom! Some search results size is smaller than page "**size**" cannot be displayed. Silly mistake but takes me long time to look for it.
